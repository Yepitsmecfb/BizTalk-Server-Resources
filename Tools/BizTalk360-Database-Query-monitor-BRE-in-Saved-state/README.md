# BizTalk360 Database Query to monitor BRE in Saved state
[BizTalk360](https://www.biztalk360.com/) offers a tool for BizTalk Administrators to monitor a BizTalk Solution by running database queries that can be evaluated against a defined threshold and receive alerts when the query does not return the expected values. The administrators can set the warning and error condition values in BizTalk360. In addition, they also need to provide the SQL Instance Name and the Database Name where the query will be executed and can target any database. The database query monitoring requires queries that return a scalar value such as string, integer or Boolean. Once the query is saved, BizTalk360 checks for the query result and alerts the administrator when the value exceeds the threshold range.

This Database Query is able Dto monitor BRE in Saved state and it can be used on BizTalk360 Alarms.
