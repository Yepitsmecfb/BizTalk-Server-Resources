# Export BizTalk Server Resource Bindings by Assembly FQName with PowerShell
Exporting a BizTalk Server Resource Bindings by Assembly fully qualified name, similar to the exporting Application Binding, is, at first sight, a simple and quick task that can be done using the BizTalk Server Administration Console. But even in simple tasks we may encounter challenges that require us to perform some monotonous and boring manual operations that consume some of our precious time and are always subject to failures.

With this PowerShell sample for a specific assembly fully qualified name deployed in my BizTalk Server environemnt I can easily:
* Generate a Binding file for 3 environments DEV, QA and PRD:
* Changing the NT Group Name for each different environment;
 
THIS POWERSHELL IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
